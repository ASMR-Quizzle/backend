We know the charge is distributed on the outer surface of a conducting hollow sphere because the charges want to maintain maximum distance among them due to repulsion. So there is no charge inside the sphere and hence no electric field.,Physics,33
33,Two point charges of the same polarities are hung with the help of two threads and kept close The angle between the threads will be _________ if the system is taken to space,180 degree,90 degree,45 degree,60 degree,A,There is gravitational field on earth so if we hang the two same charges there will be an interaction of vertical gravitational field and horizontal electric field. The system will achieve equilibrium by creating a certain angle between the threads and hence the vertical and horizontal components of forces will balance. But in space there is no gravity. So the charges will be at 180-degree separation.,Physics,34

Electrical force on the body is e*E. If the electron doesn’t fall then these two forces balance each other so m*g=E*e. Therefore E= \(\frac {(m*g)}{e}\).,Physics,35
35,Electric field is a _______,Scalar quantity,Vector quantity,Tensor quantity,Quantity that has properties of both scalar and vector,B,A scalar quantity is a quantity with magnitude only but no direction. But a vector quantity possesses both magnitude and direction. An electric field has a very specific direction (away from a positive charge or towards a negative charge). Hence electric field is a vector quantity. Moreover we have to use a vector addition for adding two electric fields.,Physics,36
36,Two point charges +4q and +q are kept at a distance of 30 cm from each other At which point between them the field intensity will be equal to zero?,15cm away from the +4q charge,20cm away from the +4q charge,7.5cm away from the +q charge,5cm away from the +q charge,B,The electric field at a distance of r from a charge q is equal to \(\frac {q}{4\pi\varepsilon_or^2}\). Let the electric field intensity will be zero at a distance of x cm from +4q charge so the fields due to the two charges will balance each other at that point. Therefore \(\frac {4q}{4\pi\varepsilon_ox^2}=\frac {q}{4\pi\varepsilon_o(30-x)^2}\). Solving this we get x=20cm. Therefore the point will be 20cm away from the +4q charge.,Physics,37
37,V/m is the unit of ______,Electric field intensity,Electric flux,Electric potential,Charge,A,E=-\(\frac {dV}{dx}\) where E is the field intensity V is potential and x is distance.

Electric flux has unit V*m V is the unit of electric potential whereas charge has a unit of Coulomb or esu.,Physics,38
38,Electric field intensity at the center of a square is _____ if +20 esu charges are placed at each corner of the square having side-length as 10 cm,0,0.4 dyne/esu,2 dyne/esu,1.6 dyne/esu,A,Distance of center from each corner point of the square is = \(\frac {10\sqrt2}{2}\) = 5√2. Therefore field intensity at the center due to a single charge is = \(\frac {20}{(5\sqrt2)^2}\) dyne/esu. But the fields due to the four charges are equal and are at perpendicular to each other. So the fields balance each other and the net electric field at the center will be equal to zero.,Physics,39
39,The electric field lines diverge from _______,Positive charge,Negative charge,Dipole,Zero potential point,A,Electric field lines always converge at a negative charge and diverge from the positive charge. If a unit positive charge is kept in an electric field the path of motion of that charge is known as field lines. Now we know that a positive charge is always pushed away by another positive charge. Thus we can find the direction of field lines near a positive charge.,Physics,40
40,Two electric field lines ______,Always intersect each other,Never intersect,May intersect sometimes,Are always perpendicular to each other,B,We know that the electric field at a point is directed towards the tangent of electric field lines at that point. Now if two field lines intersect at a point two tangents can be drawn at that point. That means at a particular point there would be two separate directions of the electric field which is impossible. So we can conclude that two electric field lines never intersect each other.,Physics,41
41,Two plates are oppositely charged uniformly and kept parallel to each other at a certain distance What will be the nature of electric field lines in between them?,Circular,Parallel to each other throughout the cross section,Not uniformly distributed,Parallel and uniform in central part but fringes out at the extreme ends,D,The electric field between two uniformly charged plates is uniform. Electric field lines in the uniform electric field are parallel to each other and uniformly distributed. This phenomenon is observed in most of the parts between the plates. But in the two extreme ends the field line fringes out due to the non-uniform electric field.,Physics,42
42,Which among the following is false about electric field lines?,They are continuous,They attract each other,They remain parallel in a uniform electric field,They diverge from positive charge,B,Electric lines of force are always diverging from positive charge and they converge at a negative charge.

These lines are continuously stretched between two opposite charges and always try to maintain minimum length.,Physics,43
43,At ‘Electrical Neutral Point’ the lines of force _______,Are absent,Coincide with each other,Always converge,Always diverge,A,Electrical neutral point is a point in between two positive and negative charges where the electric field intensity is zero. It means that no lines of force pass through that point because electric field lines are the measure of field intensity i.e. more lines mean more field intensity. The lines never converge or diverge neither they coincide at that point.,Physics,44
44,What is the unit of electric flux?,V/m,N/m,V*m,N/Coulomb,C,Flux is equal to the product of field intensity and area of the surface. But field intensity multiplied by a length gives the unit of electric potential as E=-\(\frac {dV}{dx}\). Therefore flux also means electric potential multiplied by length. This gives us the unit V*m. There is another unit of flux N*m,Physics,45
45,Which one is the correct expression of electric flux?,∫ \(\vec{E}.d\vec{s}\,∫ \(\vec{E^2}.d\vec{s}\,∫ \(\vec{E}^{-1}.d\vec{s}\,∫ \(\vec{E}.d\vec{l}\,A,Electric flux is defined as the number of field lines crossing perpendicularly through a surface area. The number of electric field lines crossing through the unit cross-section area is known as electric field intensity (E). Therefore field lines crossing through small area ds are E.ds. Taking the integral gives the flux in the entire surface.,Physics,46
46,Electric flux will be maximum if the angle between the field lines and area vector is ______,45 degree,135 degree,90 degree,0 degree,D,We know that the electric field and area both are vector quantity and the electric flux is expressed as \(\vec{E}.\vec{s}\) (taking dot product). But if the angle between the two vectors is θ then the formula becomes E.s.cosθ.Cosθ will be maximum if theta is zero in all other cases the value of Cosθ is less than 1. Therefore flux will be the maximum if the angle is 0 degrees.,Physics,47
47,If a charge is placed outside a closed surface flux due to that charge inside the surface will be ________,Positive,May be positive or negative depending on the nature of the charge,Negative,Zero,D,According to Gauss’s principle if there is no charge bound inside a surface net electric flux coming out of the surface will always be 0. In this case the charge is kept outside the surface so it will generate no field lines and hence no flux inside the surface. The situation will be the same if an electric dipole is placed inside a surface as dipole has equal positive and negative charges; the total charge inside the surface becomes 0.,Physics,48
48,Which of the following law explains the relation between the charge inside a surface and electric flux?,Gauss’s Law,Coulomb’s Law,Faraday’s Law,Pascal’s Law,A,Gauss’s Law gives the relation between electric flux and charges inside a surface. It states that electric flux coming out from a closed surface is equal to \(\frac {1}{\varepsilon}\) times the charge inside the surface.  Coulomb’s Law explains the force between two charges and Pascal’s Law is related to fluids.,Physics,49
49,If the force acting on a point charge kept on the axis of an electric dipole is F what will be the amount of force if the distance of the point charge is doubled from the dipole?,2F,\(\frac {F}{8}\,\(\frac {F}{2}\,\(\frac {F}{4}\,B,If the distance of a point charge kept on the axis of a dipole is sufficiently large than the separation between the charges of a dipole then it can be shown that electric field E at a distance r from the dipole varies as E α \(\frac {1}{r^3}\). Now if the distance becomes 2r electric field intensity will decrease by a factor of 2,Physics,50
50,If electric field intensity at a certain distance from a dipole on its axis is E1 and at the same distance but on the perpendicular bisector of the dipole is E2 then __________,E1=E2,E1=2 E2,E1=4 E2,E1=3 E2,B,If the dipole moment of a dipole is p then electric field intensity at a distance r from the dipole on its axis will be \(\frac {2p}{r^3}\). But electric field intensity at a distance r from the dipole on its perpendicular bisector is \(\frac {p}{r^3}\). Both the formulas are derived by assuming r >> length of the dipole. Thus E1=\(\frac {2p}{r^3}\) and E2=\(\frac {p}{r^3}\) and hence E1=2 E2.,Physics,51
51,Dipole moment depends on _______,Charge only,Charge and length of a dipole,Charge length of a dipole and dielectric constant of the medium,Charge and dielectric constant of the medium,B,Dipole is defined as two equal but opposite charges kept at a small distance and having a dipole moment. The dipole moment is simply the product of the electric charge and length of the dipole. The dielectric constant of the medium doesn’t affect the dipole moment i.e. dipole moment of an electric dipole will be the same in water as well as in the air.,Physics,52

The amount of charges is the same but their polarities are different. Therefore the sum of total charges in a dipole is always 0. But flux from a closed surface is related to the total charge inside a surface. As the total charge inside the cube is zero so there will be no flux coming out or going in towards the surface.,Physics,54
54,The CO,,,True,False,A,If we observe the structure of the CO,Physics,55

56,If an electric dipole is placed in a uniform electric field ______ will act on the dipole,A force but no torque,Both force and torque,Torque but no force,No torque or force,C,Dipole is the combination of two equal but opposite charges kept at a certain distance. If it is placed in a uniform electric field both the charges will suffer the same but opposite forces on them. As a result the net force on the dipole becomes zero but due to equal and opposite forces acting on two different points there is a net torque acting on the dipole.,Physics,57
57,If an electric dipole is placed in a non-uniform electric field ______ will act on the dipole,A force but no torque,Both force and torque,Torque but no force,No torque or force,B,In the case of a non-uniform electric field the force acting on both the charges of the dipole will be unequal. So there will be a net force acting on the dipole in a certain direction. Also there will be a torque due to two forces acting at two different points. But in case of a uniform electric field the net force on the dipole will be zero but net torque will be non-zero.,Physics,58
58,An electric dipole will be in stable equilibrium if the angle between the axis of the dipole and the electric field is ________,0 degree,180 degree,90 degree,45 degree,A,Torque acting on a dipole is p*E*sinθ where E is the electric field. Now θ is 0 degree so sinθ becomes 0 and hence no torque acts on the dipole. So in this case no force or torque acts on the dipole. Therefore it will be the condition of stable equilibrium. In the case of θ=180 degree sinθ is also 0 but the condition is known as unstable equilibrium i.e. if we rotate the dipole a bit it will not come back to its initial position.,Physics,59
59,If a non-polar substance is placed in an electric field what will happen?,A net dipole moment will be observed,The substance will oscillate,The substance will orient itself perpendicular to the electric field,It will conduct electricity,A,A non-polar substance consists of a huge number of dipoles in it but they are oriented randomly and hence the net dipole moment of the substance becomes 0 and it acts as a non-polar substance. But if it is placed in an electric field the dipoles present in it will orient themselves in the direction of the field and hence a net dipole moment will be observed known as induced dipole moment. No current flow or oscillation of the substance will be observed.,Physics,60

The charge stored in stat small part=λ.dl. The force due to that small part will be directed towards the unit vector \(\hat{r}\). Therefore force on that charge due to the entire linear charge distribution=q∫\(\frac {\lambda}{r^2}\hat{r}\)dl.,Physics,61

The point charge is placed at the common point of the cubes. According to Gauss’s Law net electric flux coming out of the bigger cube=\(\frac {q}{\varepsilon_o}\).

But is the CGS system the law states that flux= \((\frac {4\pi}{k})\)*electric charge [where k is the dielectric constant of the medium]. Therefore we have to replace (\(\frac {1}{\varepsilon_o}\)) with (\(\frac {4\pi}{k}\)).,Physics,64

65,Gauss’s Law cannot be applied in ________,Hollow sphere,Solid sphere,Cube,Unbounded surface,D,Gauss’s Law is valid only in case of a closed surface. Solid or hollow sphere cube are closed surface and so Gauss’s Law can be applied in those cases. But in case of unbounded surface there is no meaning of charge bounded by the surface and so Gauss’s Law cannot be applied in those cases.,Physics,66
