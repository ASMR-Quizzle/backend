Question,A,B,C,D,Answer,Explanation,Topic
Why is gold used in the Gold-leaf electroscope?,Gold is easily available in nature,Gold is malleable,Gold is conducting in nature,Gold is cheap,B,Though gold is a costly metal it is used in electroscope because of the property malleability. This means very thin and light sheets can be formed from gold simply by hammering or rolling and hence the deflection of the light gold plates increases.,Physics
What happens to the plates of the apparatus if we measure alternating charge using a Gold-leaf oscilloscope?,It doesn’t diverge at all,It diverges momentarily,The plates give a proper divergence,The degree of divergence increases and decreases repeatedly,C,"The divergence of the plates of the Gold-leaf oscilloscope depends only on the presence of a charge, not on the quality of charge i.e. positive or negative. So, if the charge changes from positive to negative and vice versa the degree of divergence of the plates remains the same.",Physics
Dr Gilbert tried to hold a brass rod by hand and induce static electricity in it by friction Why did he fail?,Static electricity is induced only on insulators while brass is conducting,The induced static charge flew through his hand and body to the ground,The static charge was not produced at all,It is not possible to induce static electricity by friction,B,The human body is a good conductor and hence the charge produced by friction flew through his body to the ground. We can tackle the problem simply by holding the brass rod with the help of some insulated holder.,Physics
Gold-leaf electroscope can be used _______,Only to detect the presence of charge,To detect the presence of charge as well as its nature (positive or negative,To measure the surface charge density,To measure current,B,If the apparatus is initially in contact with some positively charged body and then comes in contact with another charged body and if the divergence increases we can deduce that the second body is also positively charged. If the divergence decreases then the second body must be negatively charged.,Physics
Two equally charged spheres attract each other Now if they touch each other then they will _____,Attract each other with the same amount of force,Repel each other,Attract each other with less amount of force,Don’t attract or repel,D,"The two spheres are oppositely charged by the same amount. So if they come in contact, both of their charges are neutralized. So they become uncharged and don’t attract or repel each other.",Physics
Current carrier in conductors is ____,Electron,Proton,Neutron,Positron,A,Conductors have lots of free electrons that can carry electricity if the potential difference is applied across them. Protons are positively charged particle and Neutron are electrically neutral. They don’t carry electricity in conductors.,Physics
Which group among the following is insulator?,"Silver, copper, gold","Paper, glass, cotton","The human body, wood, iron","Glass, copper, paper",B,"Glass, paper, and cotton are good quality insulators. The rest options contain one or more conducting materials. Silver is the best conductor material available in nature. But it is costly, so it can’t be used in the electricity distribution system.",Physics
The band gap between the valence band and conduction band is the measure of ______,The conductivity of the material,The resistivity of the material,Charge density,Ease of ionization,A,"The more the band gap between the valence band and conduction band, the worse is the conductivity of the material. For conductors, there are overlapping bands. So, conductors can carry electricity. But there is a huge energy gap in the case of insulators. So, they don’t carry electricity at all.",Physics
The rubber used in the wheels of aero-plane is _________,Perfect insulator,Slightly conducting,Can be an insulator or conducting,Semiconductor,B,"Due to high friction during takeoff, a huge amount of charge is produced on the rubber of the wheel of a plane. This charge must be sent to the ground. So, the rubber used is slightly conducting, else the huge charge produced may produce a spark and can cause an accident.",Physics
